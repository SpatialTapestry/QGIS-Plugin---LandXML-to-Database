description=Provides LandXML to Database tools, etc, storing to PostGIS initially, later to Oracle and MS SQL.
about=Thanks for Chris Cook, LINZ.
  The LandXml format is an Xml format used to transfer cadastral survey data.
  The format can describe cadastral survey parcels, nodes, and observations.
  This plugin is used to extract information from a LandXml data file into memory layers in the QGIS plugin.
  Currently it supports parcels and nodes, and observations.
  The plugin will eventually support LXML Files from around Australia and New Zealand, and abroad as samples are provided.
  NOTE!!! This plugin will crash on initial download as there are missing Python Connectors to the databases.
  See "RubberSheetingETC.html" and "landXMLtoDB.html" in the plugin folder for User and Installation instructions. Python Database Connectors: psycopg2, oracledb, pyodbc,{Devart ODBC Driver for Oracle},{Devart ODBC Driver for SQL Server}
